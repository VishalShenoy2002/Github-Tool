# Github-Tool
Github Tool is a tool which will help non-github friendly users to clone or get a particular Repository from Github.

* The Program asks you for the Github Username. If the Username is valid then it will list the first 30 Repositories of the user.

* After that it asks you to select a repository. After selecting the repository it will display 3 Options
    1. Repositories Operations
    2. See Issues
    3. Select Different Repository

##### Choosing Repository Operations

If you choose the first option that is Repository Operations it will give you 3 option which are as follows:
1. Download the Repository
2. Download and Extract the Repository
3. Display License

**Download the Repository** will download a zip file of the repository in the current working directly.
**Download and Extract the Repository** will download a zip file of the repository and extract it in the current working directly.
**Display License** will display the License of the Repository if the License is present in the repository. If the file is not there on your local device it'll ask you if you want to extract it first.
After extraction if the Repository has a License it will display it.

##### Choosing See Issues

If you choose the second option that is See Issues it will list the issues of the repository if any issues are present and it will ask you to select the issue number. Once you choose the issue number it will open the issue on the web browser so you can read about it in detail.
